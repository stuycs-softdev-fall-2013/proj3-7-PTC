#Project

  We will be making a web application that helps teachers and parents during parent-teacher conferences. Parents will be able to sign up for conferences online and then receive notifications when it's their turn to meet the teachers they signed up for. 

#How

  Homepage branches out to parent tools and teacher tools. Parent tools allow parents to possess a schedule of their own and allow them to take a slot of a teacher's schedule. Teachers can view their schedule and choose how long they want each meeting to be. (Note to group: The parents cannot access the teachers until they select their time.)
  
#Need

  Right now, we need login/register to be fully functional. We need to get information such as student to student id, list of teachers, teachers to teaching subject.

#Edits
  
  1/25 - Tinkering with postlogin pages. Need to make the page where parents connect to teachers. ALOT of backend stuff needed.
